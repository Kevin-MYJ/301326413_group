CMPT 276 Project Proposal

version: iteration 0.0
Web Application Name: Sudoku.oni

We decided to implement an online Sudoku game. The game is mainly implemented by JavaScript. Sudoku is a very classic mathematical logic game. Since its appearance, it has been a very classic logical reasoning game. Sudoku has been published in newspapers before the Internet has become popular and has become one of the ways for many people to relax in their free time. We are now planning to implement Sudoku games using JavaScript on the web. Users need to log in before they can start playing Sudoku. We plan to add Facebook and Twitter APIs to the login interface so that users can log in directly with their Facebook or Twitter accounts. The user can start the game after logging in, the game time will be recorded, and there will be a score after successfully completing the game. The time and score will be recorded, and then a leaderboard will be created for all users who log in to our game. 
Sudoku is a mathematical logic game. Users can greatly improve their logical reasoning ability while playing Sudoku. The Main positioning of this game is a casual game. So users can relax their brains by focusing on the game in their free time. The final completion time and score can also give users a sense of satisfaction with improved ability. The target of our game audience is people who are in contact with the internet and like logical reasoning games. People who will use our projects include, but are not limited to, students, workers, elderly people, etc.
The main feature of this project is the Sudoku game. The project can also record your grades and post them in the rankings on the web when your grades are very good. In addition, we also plan to complete the feature of sharing user results on his Facebook. 
When ordinary users enter our webpage, they need to enter their username and password to log in to the game. Users who enter for the first time can choose to register or log in to the game through their Facebook or Twitter accounts. After logging in to the game, you can see the game interface. The user name, score and time of the top 10 users are displayed on the right side of the interface. The left side of the interface displays scores, game rules and operation methods. After clicking the start button, the user officially starts the game, and ends the game after completing the Sudoku game or occurring 3 error.
For our next group meeting, we will gather the information that we individually discovered together and talk about how to implement a part of our Sudoku.oni game. The goals of each of our members will be more detailed and specified.
